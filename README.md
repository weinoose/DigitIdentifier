Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install digit-identifier.

```bash
pip install digit-identifier
```

## Index and Usage

digit-identifier.mnist():
Includes python file that is a handwriting digit predicter. 
That predicter picks random handwriting digits from the MNIST algorithm and predicts both.
***
digit-identifier.image():
Includes python file that is a handwriting digit predicter. 
First of all, you have to add a 28x28 image to your dir which python file you are working in that.
